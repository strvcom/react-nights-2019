# REACT NIGHTS 2019

> This repository serves as an online course for learning React. It’s here to help those who want to learn more about React and frontend in order to develop a SPA.

## Introduction

At STRV, we believe that the best way of learning is by working on a real project. So, we’ve come up with a simple e-commerce app concept using the [Commerce Layer API](https://commercelayer.io).

> Please take note that by learning React, you will _not_ become a frontend developer. There are many other areas you should be able to handle. Stay tuned for `Frontend Nights`, where we are going to focus on everything except React. :)

### Goal

The goal of this course is to give you a fundamental understanding of how to build a production-ready React web app.

The presenters demonstrated the best practices in building React applications — experience they gained by working on numerous projects.

### Source

This online course was created by utilizing material from React Nights, the free offline course with a focus on React created by [STRV](https://www.strv.com/).

### Prerequisites

This course requires at least junior-level knowledge of programming, and relies on fundamental knowledge of React. Reading and understanding this [amazing official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) should be enough to get you started.

General frontend knowledge is beneficial, but not necessary. For more details, you can check the [video and presentation from the first lecture](#00-introduction)

## Course Structure

React Nights 2019 encompasses 8 weeks of studying, 16 lectures and 8 homework assignments. The STRV Frontend Team contributed to this repository throughout the entire course.

STRV also had a dedicated team of mentors helping our students do all of the homework. The team then reviewed the homework as well, of course. :)

> We are highly opinionated when it comes to development. There are many great approaches to writing apps; this repository shows you a process that is very close to what we do in the real world.

Our goal was to reveal some patterns incrementally. Some of the code was written in a way that required it to be refactored later. Therefore please don’t think of this repository as a recipe on how to build a React app. It’s more of a showcase of different topics all compiled into a single project.

## Lectures

Each lecture is about 1 hour long. There are 2 lectures per week, followed by 1 homework assignment. You can follow _commit history_ to see each lesson.

You can find recordings of all lectures, as well as links to every presentation, a Pull Request representing the introduction to the lecture, a link to the homework solutions and, finally, some additional resources (also listed in the presentations).

### Week 1

#### 00. Introduction

Introduction to the React Nights course. Please note that the course was designed to require a lot of self-studying during homework assignments. If you are planning to take this 16-hours course, we highly recommend you find a mentor who will review your Pull Requests.

> Of course, you don't need to wait the entire week before continuing on to the next lesson. But we do recommend dedicating some extra time to studying the shared resources.

If you have any recommendations regarding improvements to this knowledge base, feel free to submit a PR.

#### 01. Project Setup

As a project starter, we choose create-react-app. (Other great options could be Next.js or Gatsby.) Effective learning requires high-quality code, so we implement `Prettier` and `ESLint` and enforce it with a `pre-commit hook` from a combination of `husky` with `lint-staged`. And of course, as STRV developers, we use STRV's favorite configurations from [code-quality-tools](https://github.com/strvcom/code-quality-tools/).

> Note that we are not covering `stylelint` in this lesson, since it's a part of next week’s lesson - [Styling in React](#styling-in-react). Another decision that should be made from the very beginning is[TypeScript](#typescript) from [Week 7](#week-7). But to make the learning curve a bit easier, we decided to add that later. If you are brave enough, feel free to start using it right away.

Before we start to implement features, let’s get the API communication ready. And before any implementation, you should get familiar with whichever API you are going to use.

For our demo, we choose CommerceLayer API. We first read its [API Reference](https://commercelayer.io/api/reference/) and see we need to implement authentication to be able to get any resources. To do that, we need to create an account in CommerceLayer and get a token from API.

For a demonstration of correct implementation, we fetch `List of Products`.

That’s all for now. Let's write a simple README about what we did, and how this project can be used.

#### Homework #1

> This homework assignment was implemented during the lecture; see its Pull Request above.

- Set up [commercelayer.io](https://commercelayer.io/)
- Project Setup
  - Project starter
  - API & config
  - Fetch list of products
  - Code quality tools
  - Documentation
- Read _Main Concepts_ in [amazing React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

### Week 2

#### 02. Project Architecture & React Router

The plan for this lecture is to implement `Product Detail`. For routing, we use [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). But before we start writing code, let's think about how we will structure the whole project. At STRV, we are fans of [grouping by features or routes](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#grouping-by-features-or-routes). This kind of decision should have already been made in lecture [01. Project Setup](#01-project-setup). So now, we need to refactor our code a little bit.

We will use another API endpoint, so now’s probably a good time to implement `a simple http API client`. We will use native [fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) for simplicity, but otherwise we highly recommend [ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky) (tiny & elegant HTTP client based on `window.fetch`) or [rest-hooks](https://github.com/coinbase/rest-hooks).

Now everything is set and ready. Let's go for the `Product Detail`!

> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLhApVdlZaQ) | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tKTUkn4MtT5_ahwp2nfWijNWvplboi015tdbUx98Wis/edit#slide=id.g5521228db6_0_28) | [Pull Request](https://github.com/strvcom/react-nights-2019/pull/2)

#### 03. Styling in React

We have a List of Products and Product Detail. Before we move further, let's implement some decent styles, so that the app is more pleasant to work with.

At STRV, we are big fans of CSS-in-JS - namely `styled-components`. A brief introduction to history, benefits, and usage of styled-components. A showcase of `styled-system` and `@rebass/grid`

We also set up the first **styleguide**. Styles live in the `styled.js` file, next to the component. The only exception are global styles and variables files.

With CSS comes huge responsibility. A friendly check put into pre-commit hook by `stylelint` is what you need.

And when building a real project, you should definitely check out the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

### Week 3

#### 04. Global State Management

Now is a great time to implement `Cart`, as well as the possibility to add products to it. We choose to demonstrate this functionality with Redux, which is one of the most widespread libraries in the React ecosystem. In this lesson, we start with gaining an understanding regarding the state management problem, we explore a number of concepts crucial for implementing the robust state management solution, and we get to build it into our project using Redux best practices.

#### 05. Context API & Redux Middlewares

Redux comes with great middlewares. Let's briefly check what it’s all about. We will leverage this knowledge in the [10. Async Effects & Error Reporting](#10-async-effects--error-reporting) lecture.

Besides that, it's also our duty to showcase a `Context API`, which is more than suitable for many use cases. But without any contribution to the project.

#### Homework #3

- `Add to Cart` feature on Product Detail page
- `Remove from Cart` feature on Cart page
- Implement [redux-devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) and use it with [extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
- Extract `Button` component to make it reusable
- Add `Layout` to Product Detail page
- Update API for getting a list and a single product to return response in the same format
- `onAddToCart` function expects only productId as an argument. Calling `event.preventDefault()` is done internally now to avoid leaking implementation details to outside components
- Remove pseudo-caching logic in ProductList component

### Week 4

#### 06. Forms

Proper e-commerce should have a user profile, where our users can change their information or see their past orders. Let's implement a `Sign Up` page with [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) and do a client-side validation with [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)

> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcNhRhm9MwI&list=PLfX7tWavkVjAz0fCSZn47RvbcsTwTfD0U&index=2) | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSpqe7AWG8ofkxUxKIDB4_Az2qBS8S_Z3FVdPhTdESw/edit#slide=id.g5521228db6_0_28) | [Pull Request](https://github.com/strvcom/react-nights-2019/pull/6)

#### 07. Authentication & Routing in Depth

Sign in, authentication, private routes, redirecting. With this lesson, our app is almost ready.

#### Homework #4

- Create the login page with a `login form`
- Connect login form to API
- Get customer information and store it in Redux
- Determine in `PrivateRoute` whether a user is authenticated
- Show/hide `MyProfile` link according to the authenticated state
- Add `log out` functionality

### Week 5

> Our app is almost ready. Now is the time to properly tune it! Of course, in the real world, we should start following "advanced" patterns right away. But for learning purposes, we believe that this is the easiest way how to understand it.

#### 08. Functional Programming

React is functional, so let's learn how to make our app functional as well. This is more of a theoretical lecture, with great examples in the Observable notebook.

> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7sW_-zCQog&list=PLfX7tWavkVjAz0fCSZn47RvbcsTwTfD0U&index=3) | [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@varholak-peter/react-nights-playground) | [Pull Request]()

#### 09. HOCs, Render Props, Hooks

During the previous lesson, we saw many code repetitions. Let's make it more DRY!

> In this lesson we are doing a minor refactor from redux to hooks. On first sight, it looks good and awesome, but it will backfire us in ### [Week 7](#week-7). This was done on purpose; it allows us to demonstrate that every decision in your codebase matters and requires a lot of thinking.

> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7sW_-zCQog&list=PLfX7tWavkVjAz0fCSZn47RvbcsTwTfD0U&index=3&t=2652) | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hy0bWktlaEzYI0-AYFa_6X4BQr4rG__tgLjasEMBSmA/edit) | [Pull Request](https://github.com/strvcom/react-nights-2019/pull/10)

#### Homework #5

We’ve now done a major refactor to display how Hooks can save us a lot of typing.

- Product List and Product Detail have been moved to a different route, and root route redirects to Product List
- Route paths have been moved in constants into separate file `src/routes.js`
- New route for 404 error was added; it will be shown in case none of the other routes are matched: https://github.com/strvcom/react-nights-2019/blob/320178fb8afd3799066c02d364b46089aeb29c7d/src/App.js#L38

### Week 6

#### 10. Async Effects & Error Reporting

So far we were following a happy path of development, meaning that everything should be working as expected. But in the real world, that’s never the case. From time to time, the API server is down, internet connection is weak or there is an unexpected error in our code.

> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5URcw_KYFM&list=PLfX7tWavkVjAz0fCSZn47RvbcsTwTfD0U&index=10) | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JCvCloP-MmZAFA6oY0tCUs6jVs_pIzUavwJMl5UYtPY/edit#slide=id.g51136236ec_0_25) | [Pull Request](https://github.com/strvcom/react-nights-2019/pull/13)

#### 11. Testing in React

Testing is very important in the development of any software. Let's take a look at how it works in the React world. Pull Request comes with a lot of practical examples.

> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5URcw_KYFM&list=PLfX7tWavkVjAz0fCSZn47RvbcsTwTfD0U&index=10&t=3263) | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZCHj9FJabHUxmTw9U6cH9-Zgb3u7m7K9TxOt6MNqrYc/edit#slide=id.g5c04da16b1_1_0) | [Pull Request](https://github.com/strvcom/react-nights-2019/pull/12)

#### Homework #6

- Move logic to chosen async solution _(default: redux-thunks, advanced: redux-sagas, redux-observables)_
- Handle refresh tokens
- Notify a user about errors from `server/network` and `success` _(product added to cart/deleted from cart/logged in)_
- To mock server responses `401/500` you can use https://www.charlesproxy.com/
- If you find this homework too easy, please refer to `Up for the challenge?` slide for [problem inspiration](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JCvCloP-MmZAFA6oY0tCUs6jVs_pIzUavwJMl5UYtPY/edit#slide=id.g56a65efc51_0_57)

### Week 7

#### 12. TypeScript

TypeScript is really trendy these days. We love it at STRV. Hopefully, you will love it too!

In this lesson, we start with the basics of static typing and move on to more advanced topics, such as derived types and type guards. The aim is to bring the power of TypeScript into our application and see how we can type components, reducers and API calls.

> [Video](https://youtu.be/L9B4n4f0ibE) | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17-9y7PEbOhdM2hPm0xtvSe6WYxyg_WLFKgTE63WQgtk/) | [Pull Request](https://github.com/strvcom/react-nights-2019/pull/15)

#### 13. Server-side Rendering vs. Static Export

Since we are going to production soon, let's think about how our app should work there.Since we are going to production soon, let's think about how our app should work once it’s live.

Because of widely dynamic content, it does make sense to do a SSR. We choose Next.js.

> This introduces a major refactor. We could probably choose `razzle`, which has a react-router under the hood. But still, it usually makes sense to make this kind of decision at the very beginning of the project.

> [Video](https://youtu.be/_F_YbLNwkuE) | [Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XEWNDDZ4Xw8ywGu-0Kn0rSq-jiRKmAAJ/view?usp=sharing) | [Pull Request](https://github.com/strvcom/react-nights-2019/pull/18)

#### Homework #7

- TypeScript
- Move from create-react-app to Next.js
  - This is a huge refactor.
  - It refers to proper project setup. Meaning you should know what you are building from the very beginning; otherwise, you can choose incorrectly and then spend extra time with an **unneeded refactor**.
  - Convert your codebase into SSR using STRV branch as reference
  - Remove `react-scripts`
  - Add `next` and related libraries (`@zeit/next-css`, `@zeit/next-typescript`, `express`, `isomorphic-fetch`, `next-redux-wrapper`, `@types/next`)
  - Adjusts scripts section of your `package.json` to work with next instead of `react-scripts`, check the one defined in the project for reference.
  - Replace `useApi` hook usage on Products List and Products Details with `getInitialProps`, you could either set the data in redux or show it right away as the hook did.
  - If you’re feeling like a ninja, implement the loading status in case you decide to go with the redux approach.

### Week 8

#### 14. Optimizing React Apps

Our app seems to be working fine. Let's talk about optimization and bringing users the best user experience possible.

> [Video](https://youtu.be/srxHbr346A4) | [Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12i45GV6_gNjCFnwKs23owjpGPwphc04-/view)

#### 15. Deployment

Finally, it's time to deploy our production-ready app!

> Again: in the real world, (continuous) deployment could be set up in earlier stages of a project’s lifetime.
