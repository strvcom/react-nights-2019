## Homework (Optional)

- Convert your codebase into SSR using STRV branch as reference
- Remove `react-create-scripts`
- Add `next` and related libraries (`@zeit/next-css`, `@zeit/next-typescript`, `express`, `isomorphic-fetch`, `next-redux-wrapper`, `@types/next`)
- Adjusts scripts section of your `package.js` to work with next instead of `react-create-scripts`, check the one defined in the project for reference.
- Replace `useApi` hook usage on products and products details with `getInitialProps`, you could either set the data in redux or show it
  right away as the hook did.
- If you are feeling like a ninja, implement the loading status in case you decide to go with the redux approach.
